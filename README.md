## Run the application
1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
2. Run the project locally with `yarn start`

## Q&A
1. What does our homework mainly examine?
- ability to implement UI/UX and animations from basics, without using third-party library
- customize and style components with `styled-components`
- detail-oriented, make sure the implementation matches the provided designs
2. Which development standard do you follow?
- modularize reusable components, styles and configurations
3. Have you met some difficulties and how did you solve them?
- `create-react-app` is quite outdated and have lots of issues related to typescript, webpack, custom paths. It's required to bundle with `craco` to show the mentioned issues. Since it's not necessary for the demo of this test app, `craco` set up is not included
- `styled-components` and `create-react-app` are not popular lately, which requires time to review and ramp up
4. Do you have any advice for our homework?
- the choice on starter kit should be more flexible, with options like `react-next-app` or `vite`. The required one, `react-react-app` is quite outdated and have some unresolved issues.
